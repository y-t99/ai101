### Flux AI Models Series: Pro, Dev, Schnell

> refer: [flux101 - flux-model](https://flux101.com/en/basics/flux-model)

The Flux model family consists of three variants: Flux Pro, Flux Dev, and Flux Schnell. Each variant is designed for different use cases, ranging from professional-grade image generation to efficient local development.

#### Flux Pro

Closed-source model, providing the best performance, suitable for commercial applications. Currently, you can only use it through the API, or use the application that calls this API.

#### Flux Dev

Open-source model, not for commercial use, distilled from the Pro version, with similar image quality and prompt following capabilities, but more efficient.

#### Flux Schnell

Open-source model, based on the Apache 2.0 license, designed for local development and personal use, with the fastest generation speed and the smallest memory footprint.

## Stable Diffusion

> - [wiki/Stable_Diffusion#Releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion#Releases)

- **Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large**: At 8 billion parameters, with superior quality and prompt adherence, this base model is the most powerful in the Stable Diffusion family. This model is ideal for professional use cases at 1 megapixel resolution.
- **Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo**: A distilled version of Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large. SD3.5 Large Turbo generates high-quality images with exceptional prompt adherence in just 4 steps, making it considerably faster than Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large.
- **Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium**: With 2.5 billion parameters, the model delivers an optimal balance between prompt accuracy and image quality, making it an efficient choice for fast high-performance image generation.

- **SD3 Large**: the 8 billion parameter model
- **SD3 Large Turbo**: the 8 billion parameter model with a faster inference time
- **SD3 Medium**: the 2 billion parameter model
- **Stable Diffusion XL Turbo**
- **Stable Diffusion XL**
- **SD 2.x**
- **SD 1.x**
